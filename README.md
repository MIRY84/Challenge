# Code Refactor Horiseon



This is a project of refactoring a code on Horiseon website to make it accessible to users with impaired vision and various disabilities.
I have changed the website through enhancing accessible criterias:


* Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code
* HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* Image and icon elements contain accessible `alt` attributes
* Heading attributes fall in sequential order
* Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title
